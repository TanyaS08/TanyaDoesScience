A Scientist in training who loves playing in the mountains while spending hours on my knees and getting my hands dirty attempting to understand the role of microclimates in shaping species interactions. If I'm not too busy gushing about how cute a particular grass (or succulent) is I can probably be found hanging off of the sides of mountains or going on bike-ventures to various coffee shops. When the weather forces me indoors I'm most likely spending way more time than I need to trying to automate a process that could be done in a few minutes or exercising my creative side by playing around with the idea of becoming a scientific illustrator or finding new (and pretty) ways in which to visualise data and results.
