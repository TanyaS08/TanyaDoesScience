A Scientist in training (and self-diagnosed theoretical ecologist) who loves playing outside in the mountains and wants to understand why communities are structured the way that they are. Being the ~~maths geek~~ nerd that I am my PhD has taken on a distinctly computational flavour and aims to help us improve our understanding and ability to make more global generalisations about ecological communities - although I sometimes find myself reverting back to my 'microecology' roots and getting caught up in the weeds at times ðŸ™ˆ. Current interests include (but are not limited to): ecological networks, species traits, the role of scale and how *all that* fits together as a member of the **amazing** (if you ask me) {{% mention "PoisotLab" %}} along with a (seemingly) ever growing list of side projects.

 A plant ecologist by inclination I can usually be found gushing about how cute a particular grass (or succulent) is, hanging off of the side of a mountain or going on bike-ventures to various coffee shops. When the weather forces me indoors I'm most likely spending way more time than I need to trying to automate a process that could be done in a few minutes, exercising my creative side (I produce a fortnightly comic for the [Ecology for the Masses](https://ecologyforthemasses.com/) blog) or trying to find new (and pretty) ways in which to visualise data and results *i.e.* combining my geeky self with my artistic alter-ego.
