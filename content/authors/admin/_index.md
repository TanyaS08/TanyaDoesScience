A Scientist in training who loves playing outside in the mountains and very much wants to understand why communities look the way that they do. In order to address the latter I've decided to learn about (and incorporate) more computational approaches to hopefully begin to draw more global patterns and conclusions.

 A plant ecologist by inclination I can usually be found gushing about how cute a particular grass (or succulent) is, hanging off of the side of a mountain or going on bike-ventures to various coffee shops. When the weather forces me indoors I'm most likely spending way more time than I need to trying to automate a process that could be done in a few minutes, exercising my creative side (keeping the option to switch to scientific illustration open ðŸ˜‰) or finding new (and pretty) ways in which to visualise data and results i.e. combining my love for programming with my inner artist.
