We are in the era of big data, big models and big threats. Every day we understand more about the biodiversity on the planet, and every day this biodiversity becomes more threatened. How do we best use this accumulating biodiversity knowledge to understand and predict biodiversity change?

We approach this question from quantitative, biogeographic, and macro-ecological perspectives. Our core focus is biodiversity modelling, and we use traits, phylogenies, and species interactions to help ground these models in ecological reality.

But, we donâ€™t stop there. We also need to translate important findings from biodiversity research into a form useable for conservation applications. Which taxa serve important (and possibly overlooked) roles, where are they, and how could we protect them?
