We are interested by the complex interaction between species distribution, community structure and ecosystem functioning. We study different ecosystems, from bacteria to forest stands and use theoretical models to develop hypotheses and extend our work beyond the technical limitations of empirical studies. Simulation and analytical models are useful because they provide us a tight control of the ecological processes we are interested in and because they could be manipulated in some manners that would be otherwise impossible on the field.
