This project focuses on assembling the Canadian terrestrial metaweb and will,
in a way, be a 'testing ground' for some of the concepts from other projects
(*i.e* phylogenetic inference of ecological interactions through network
embedding, more so the idea of using a *t-SVD* as the basis of this process)
as well as incorporating some of the points outlined and discussed in chapter two. This
project forms part of a CIEE working group and, in addition to this prediction focused
component will also feature an expert elicitation project which will be
and used as a complement to the computational approach. These different approaches
will ultimately be combined into one metaweb to rule them all.

We've been doing some interim work with the mammalian component of the
