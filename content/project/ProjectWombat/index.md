This project will focus on
the variation of networks across space. More explicitly the idea of trying to
delineate networks into discrete patches (ecotrophic zones) by drawing boundaries
based on areas of rapid change. Spatial wombling will be used as the edge
detection method. This project will have three components.
The first will be to develop a *Julia* package that implements the wombling
algorithm. This will be submitted the *The Journal of Open Science* as a
software package/manuscript. The second phase will focus on how network boundaries
in a landscape compare to other community metrics such as species composition or
turnover and will result in a methods/perspectives type piece. The third (and
arguably most interesting) phase will focus more on structural changes within
networks across space and lean heavily on using motifs and graphlet theory.
