*I'd like to start off with a disclaimer:* This isn't a blog post on R being a better or more superior language (I'm a big fan of finding what works for you) but rather more of a discussion around my experience with the RStudio IDE and what makes it great for the researchers that are not big into becoming computer scientists

So it's really no secret that science is starting to 'get with the times' when it comes to open science and reproducibility. One of the big shifts is moving towards using a more code-based workflow when doing analyses. However, that being said I think most students embarking on their adventures in science (and specifically ecology) aren't necessarily interested in becoming the next 'hacker' (although there is some appeal to entertaining the fantasy every time I boot up my text editor of choice for the day) and might find the coding aspect of research quite 'scary'. That's (at least in my opinion) where the RStudio environment comes in to be pretty handy...

Some points in favour of RStudio:
* R is the current language of choice for most ecologists
* Ecologists have worked on developed packages to preform many analyses
 + Giving users a very 'complete' library of tools
 + This makes analyses more accessible to those note mathematically/statistically/coding inclined
*
