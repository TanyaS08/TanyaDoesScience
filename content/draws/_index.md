A space for some of my more creative endeavours, both with regards to communicating science but also (and possibly more importantly) just because ðŸ˜Š

## The creative side

{{< gallery album="1" >}}

### The skeletal critters collection

{{< gallery album="assets/images/draws/skeletal">}}

### Gryphons of the world

Still working on the collection for this one - when thats done we can do a full phylogeny

{{< gallery album="assets/images/draws/gryphons" >}}

## The 'serious side' - dabbling in #DataViz and general #SciComm

{{< gallery album="2" >}}
