Personally I'm a firm believer that we all have a creative side and it's all about finding our outlet - mine happens to be using visual media to create.

Admittedly my art is a little bit all over the place - but hey it's all about what the muse 'duct tapes' and as long as I'm having fun then who cares!!

### Gryphons of the world

Still working on the collection for this one - when thats done we can do a full phylogeny

## The 'serious side'- dabbling in #DataViz and general #SciComm
