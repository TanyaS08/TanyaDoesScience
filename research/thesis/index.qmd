## Toolsâ€™ O the Times: Understanding the common properties of species interaction networks across space

![](thesis.jpg){width=100%}
 
My thesis can be thought of in terms of two acts, which are driven by the central problem that we lack both information about species interactions and have a limited understanding of large scale 'patterns'. Act 1 focuses on the development of tools that can help us fill in the gaps that we have when it comes to knowing which species interact and Act 2 represents a development of tools that we can use to interrogate networks

## Publications

#### Tools for predicting species interactions

* In [Strydom & Catchen et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2021.0063), we present a discussion (and roadmap) of both why and how we can use models to help us to predict species interactions as well as networks. 

* In [Strydom et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13835) and [Strydom et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14228), we present a an overview of graph embedding and transfer learning as a way to predict species interaction, using the prediction of the Canadian mammalian metaweb as a proof of concept. 

#### Tools for understanding species interactions

* In [Strydom et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.623141) we showcase the complexity in defining the complexity of networks. Specifically we use SVD entropy as a way to measure the physical complexity of networks. 

* In [Strydom & Poisot. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ecog.06609), we present the `SpatialBoundaries.jl` package. Which uses the spatial wombling algorithm to detect areas of change (boundaries) in the landscape.
