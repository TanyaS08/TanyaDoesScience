Alongside my core research themes, I contribute to collaborative and applied ecological research spanning plant functional traits, microclimate effects, and large-scale data synthesis. Much of this work emerges from interdisciplinary collaborations and working groups, where I apply quantitative and network-based approaches to diverse ecological questions.

### Data Synthesis & Trait-Based Ecology

Contributor to large-scale, collaborative efforts that develop data infrastructure and quantitative methods for trait-based ecology. This work focuses on improving how ecological trait data are compiled, analyzed, and interpreted across systems and scales.

* Contributor to the [TRY database]( https://doi.org/10.1111/gcb.14904), supporting global-scale analyses of plant functional diversity and ecological strategies
* Bootstrapping outperforms community-weighted approaches for estimating phenotypic trait distributions, improving inference under data limitation [Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.14160)
* Plant species and traits respond to environmental gradients and microclimate variation across landscapes [Journal of Vegetation Science, 2023](https://doi.org/10.1111/jvs.13197); [Oikos, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1111/oik.09617)

### Community Science & Responsible Research

Participant in interdisciplinary working groups focused on data synthesis, open science, and the future of ecological research. These projects emphasize collaboration, inclusivity, the co-development of research agendas and training models, and examining how scientific practices, tools, and incentives shape ecological research outcomes.
