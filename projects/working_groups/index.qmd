Predicting food webs across space while correctly reflecting their uncertainty is an important goal of network ecology. We took a probabilistic metaweb (a network of potential feeding relationships) for Canada, broke it down into localized units, and propagated the uncertainty of species interactions to highlight areas with uncertain network compositions (black holes) and areas with reliable ones (revelations). The aim of this working group was to identify priority sampling locations for interaction data that would be the most efficient at reducing uncertainty in network predictions.
