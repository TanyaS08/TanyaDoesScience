## Howzit!

A Scientist in training (and self-diagnosed theoretical ecologist) who loves playing outside in the mountains and wants to understand why communities are structured the way that they are. Being the ~~maths geek~~ nerd that I am my research has a distinctly computational flavour and aims to help us improve our understanding and ability to make more global generalisations about ecological communities through the use of food webs - although I sometimes find myself reverting back to my 'microecology' roots and getting caught up in the weeds at times ðŸ™ˆ. Current interests include (but are not limited to): ecological networks, species traits, the role of scale and how *all that* fits together. Now also featuring dinosaurs! ðŸ¦–

 A plant ecologist by inclination I can usually be found gushing about how cute a particular grass (or succulent) is, hanging off of the side of a mountain or going on bike-ventures to various coffee shops. When the weather forces me indoors I'm most likely spending way more time than I need to trying to automate a process that could be done in a few minutes, exercising my creative side or trying to find new (and pretty) ways in which to visualise data and results *i.e.* combining my geeky self with my artistic alter-ego.

I use she/they pronouns.
