      <description>&lt;p&gt;Providing an overview of the
toolset that we would need to predict networks across both time and space.
The core idea behind this project is to produce a roadmap for grad student by
grad students envisioning the future quests we could conceivably go on. The
primary focus is on the need to develop a multi-faceted way to begin the
conceptualisation network prediction as well as taking advantage of the growth
of complex computational tools and the availability of data to facilitate the
prediction process&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;singular-value-decomposition-a-multitool-for-network-ecology&#34;&gt;Singular value decomposition: a multitool for network ecology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ecological networks can be represented by their adjacency matrices, &lt;em&gt;i.e.&lt;/em&gt;
a matrix for which every entry represents a species pair, and takes either
a value of 1 if there is an interaction between the two species, or 0
when there is none. Singular Value Decomposition ([SVD)
is the factorisation of a matrix $\mathbf{A}$
(where $\mathbf{A}_{m,n} \in\mathbb{B}$, in the context of adjacency matrices) into the form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \mathbf{U}\cdot\mathbf{\Sigma}\cdot\mathbf{V}^T $$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $\mathbf{U}$ is an $m \times m$ orthogonal matrix and
$\mathbf{V}$ an $n \times n$ orthogonal matrix. The columns in these matrices
are, respectively, the left- and right-singular vectors of $\mathbf{A}$.
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$ is a diagonal matrix that contains only non-negative $\sigma$
values. Where $\sigma_{i} = \Sigma{ii}$, and contains the singular values of
$\mathbf{A}$. When the values of $\mathbf{\sigma}$ are arranged in
descending order, the singular values ($\mathbf{\Sigma}$) are
unique. These singular values can broadly be viewed as a measure of
how informative that rank of the matrix is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;svd-entropy-as-a-measure-of-complexity&#34;&gt;SVD Entropy as a measure of complexity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use SVD and more specifically SVD entropy as a measure of network complexity.
This approach looks at the &amp;lsquo;physical complexity&amp;rsquo; of networks - which is in
contrast to more traditional measures such as connectence and nestedness which
look at the &amp;lsquo;behavioural complexity&amp;rsquo; of networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;svd-entropy-and-network-assembly&#34;&gt;SVD Entropy and network assembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An additional concept that I want to explore (if there is enough time) is the
relationship between network assembly and constraints on complexity (SVD entropy).
This will be building on a small section of the SVD entropy manuscript&lt;br&gt;
relating to network assembly and the constraints on complexity.&lt;/p&gt;
