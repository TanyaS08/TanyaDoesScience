      <description>&lt;p&gt;This project focuses on assembling the Canadian terrestrial metaweb and will,
in a way, be a &amp;lsquo;testing ground&amp;rsquo; for some of the concepts from other projects
(&lt;em&gt;i.e&lt;/em&gt; phylogenetic inference of ecological interactions through network
embedding, more so the idea of using a &lt;em&gt;t-SVD&lt;/em&gt; as the basis of this process)
as well as incorporating some of the points outlined and discussed in chapter two. This
project forms part of a CIEE working group and, in addition to this prediction focused
component will also feature an expert elicitation project which will be
and used as a complement to the computational approach. These different approaches
will ultimately be combined into one metaweb to rule them all.&lt;/p&gt;
