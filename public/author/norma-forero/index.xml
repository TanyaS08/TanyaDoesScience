      <description>&lt;p&gt;Providing an overview of the
toolset that we would need to predict networks across both time and space.
The core idea behind this project is to produce a roadmap for grad student by
grad students envisioning the future quests we could conceivably go on. The
primary focus is on the need to develop a multi-faceted way to begin the
conceptualisation network prediction as well as taking advantage of the growth
of complex computational tools and the availability of data to facilitate the
prediction process&lt;/p&gt;
